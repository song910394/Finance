# Communication Protocol

## Language Requirement
**ALWAYS** use **Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)** for:
1.  **Conversational Responses**: All chat messages must be in Traditional Chinese.
2.  **Documentation**: All markdown files, artifacts (Implementation Plans, Walkthroughs), and explanatory text must be in Traditional Chinese.
3.  **Comments**: Code comments should be in Traditional Chinese unless they are standard JSDoc tags.

**Exception**: 
- Code variable names, function names, class names, and file paths should remain in English.
- Standard technical terms (e.g., `React`, `TypeScript`, `API`) can be used in English.

## Verification
Before sending any message or creating any file, verify:
- [ ] Is the content in Traditional Chinese?
- [ ] Are technical terms preserved correctly?
